    "Consider robot trajectory generation using a two-segment spline where each segment is a cubic polynomial (see equation 7.10 of the text). \n",
    "\n",
    "a. Sketch the graphs of position, velocity and acceleration for initial angle 0=5.0 deg, the via-point angle v=15.0 deg. and final angle f=40.0 deg. Assume that the duration of each segment is 1.0 sec (i.e. total duration of  2 sec), and the velocity at the via point is to be 17.5 deg/sec. \n",
    "    \n",
    "b. Use the cycloid trajectory, with the same initial 0=5.0 deg and final f=40.0 deg  joint angles, and the total duration of 2 sec. Compare the maximum velocity and acceleration with the two segment cubic polynomial in (a), which trajectory is better and why?"
